# jupyterlab_practice

This is a project from Assignment 7 of the Data Science Toolbox course. We used what we've learnt on GitHub, Conda, and JupyterLab to completed a various tasks as requested in the instructions. Please see below for a specfic list of action items.

## Actions
1. We used JupyterLab to create a new "developer-1" branch for all the edits that we are making locally for our assignment.
2. We used Conda to created a new "practice_env" environment, it has been exported as "environment.yaml", and it is available to work on different operating systems.
3. We used Conda to created a new "jupyterlab_practice" environment, it has been exported as "jupyterlab_practice_environment.yaml", and it is available to work on different operating systems.
4. We used JupyterLab to create a separate notebook for Question 11 and it contains a math equation.
5. We used JupyterLab to create a separate notebook for Question 12 and it has a command to export the jupyter notebook to HTML without showing any of the input cells.
6. We also merged all the changes from "developer-1" branch to our main branch.
